# The New York Times Games Advent Calendar

Each day of this holiday-themed advent calendar is a gift containing games (designed by yours truly) modeled after four of my personal favorite New York Times Games puzzles: **The Mini**, **Wordle**, **Connections**, and **Strands**.

Go to the [nytadventcalendar.vercel.app](https://nytadventcalendar.vercel.app) to start playing!

### Appendix

This code is written on a Node.js + Express.js server deployed on Vercel. The game solutions are currently hardcoded in .txt files and stored on the client side (don't peek!).
