# The New York Times Games Advent Calendar

Each day of this holiday-themed advent calendar is a gift containing games (designed by yours truly) modeled after four of my personal favorite New York Times Games puzzles: **The Mini**, **Wordle**, **Connections**, and **Strands**. 

The advent calendar will start when you attempt any of the four games. The days will then progress once the local time turns midnight––make sure to play the games every day because you can't go back!

Go to [nytadventcalendar.vercel.app](https://nytadventcalendar.vercel.app) to start playing!

It is highly recommended to play in your mobile browser as the UI is adapted for the phone screen dimensions.

*Caution: The website heavily uses cookies to store in-game progress. Resetting your browser's cookies will reset the number of days advanced in the advent calendar.*

The server code is written in Node.js + Express.js and deployed on Vercel. The client code is written in vanilla JS and is responsible for the game design logic and DOM manipulation. The game solutions are currently hardcoded in .txt files and stored on the client side (don't peek!).
