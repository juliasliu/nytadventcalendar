On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me... a partridge in a pear tree?
You better watch out, you better not cry! You better not pout, I'm telling you why... Santa Claus is coming to town!
Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the fire is so delightful, and since we've no place to go, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
On the fourth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me... four calling birds, three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree.
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock, jingle bells swing, and jingle bells ring...
Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la, la la la la!
Frosty the Snowman was a jolly, happy soul, with a corncob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made of coal!
Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus, underneath the mistletoe last night...
¡Feliz navidad! ¡Feliz navidad! Feliz navidad, ¡prospero año y felicidad!
Merry merry merry merry Christmas... merry merry merry merry Christmas!
All I want for Christmas... is YOU!
